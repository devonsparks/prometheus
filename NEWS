Version 2 (2006-06-04): Complete rewrite

  After the insight that simple security is impossible, Prometheus
  was rewritten from scratch ontop of a much cleaner and simpler
  basis.

  The only User-visible difference is that the SLOTS->LIST message got
  replaced by IMMEDIATE-SLOT-LIST. This message returns a list of
  immediate slots in the receiving object. Each element has three
  elements: The name of the getter, the name of the setter (or #f),
  and the type, where the type is one of 'VALUE, 'METHOD or 'PARENT.


Version 1 (2005-08-09): Initial release

  The initial release of the system to the public: Prometheus rising.
