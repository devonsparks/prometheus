* Overview                                         -*- outline -*-

Prometheus is a prototype-based message-passing object system. This
means that there are no classes, but instead, objects are created and
modified on the fly until they match the specified behavior. Then,
these objects can be "cloned" into a new object which inherits the
whole behavior of the parent objects. An object in this world is just
a set of named slots which can be accessed or run by sending a message
to the object.

In Prometheus, objects are closures that receive as the first argument
a message selector, and arguments to the message as remaining
arguments. See the Prometheus manual for further information.

* Quickstart

In Scheme48, do:

> ,config ,load .../prometheus/scheme/packages.scm
> ,open prometheus
> (define my-object (*the-root-object* 'clone))
> (my-object 'add-value-slot! 'fnord 'set-fnord! 23)
> (my-object 'fnord)
23


* Bugs and limitations

No bugs known to me, but look at the Pitfalls section in the
Prometheus manual: (info "(prometheus)Pitfalls")

This object system does not intend to integrate with the rest of
Scheme. It's only a tool to describe a problem domain.

This project abuses too many names from Greek mythology. The author
apologizes profusely for this.
